# Charts

This folder contains charts produced from the data in my_working_data.csv (vaccine-hesitancy/group_data/my_working_data.csv). The project required that 3-4 attributes be shown visually. Some key points:

 + There is a positive linear relationship between the number of vaccinated individuals in a state and the population within the state.

 + The more democratic states tend to have a higher proportion of their population being fully vaccinated, while the republican states are more hesitant to COVID    
   vaccination.

 + There is a positive correlation between the percentage of individuals in a state who have a bachelorâ€™s degree (or higher) and the proportion of individuals that are fully 
   vaccinated.
