# DATA1902 Project on Vaccine Hesitancy

This repository contains my contribution to a data science project at the University of Sydney. I've included data, python code, and analysis of data which I, along with my group in DATA1902, believe may impact COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the USA. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please email me at [ronanpotts6@gmail.com](mailto:ronanpotts6@gmail.com).
